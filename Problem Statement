Enterprise organizations using SAP S/4HANA face increasing pressure to modernize
legacy infrastructure while ensuring business continuity, security, and cost efficiency.

Traditional on-premise ERP deployments often require high operational cost,
limited scalability, and complex disaster recovery planning.

This project addresses the question:
How can an enterprise assess the readiness of SAP S/4HANA workloads for cloud migration,
and what high-level strategy can support a secure and scalable transition to AWS?
