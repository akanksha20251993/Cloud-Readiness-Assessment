Project Overview
This graduate-level project evaluates the cloud readiness of an enterprise SAP S/4HANA
environment and proposes a high-level migration strategy aligned with AWS Cloud
Practitioner and foundational cloud architecture principles.

With the increasing adoption of cloud-based enterprise platforms, organizations must
carefully assess scalability, availability, cost efficiency, and security requirements
before migrating mission-critical ERP workloads.

Objective
The objective of this project is to apply cloud computing concepts in a structured
enterprise case study, focusing on:

- SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS model evaluation  
- Migration planning and roadmap development  
- Cost optimization and performance considerations  
- Risk, compliance, and cloud security controls  

Key Deliverables
- Cloud service model comparison (SaaS/PaaS/IaaS)
- AWS-based target architecture design
- Gantt-based migration roadmap
- Cost and scalability analysis
- Security and risk management framework

AWS Services Referenced
- Amazon EC2 (Compute Infrastructure)
- Amazon S3 (Storage and Backup)
- Amazon RDS (Managed Database Services)
- AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- Amazon CloudWatch (Monitoring and Logging)
- Amazon VPC (Enterprise Networking)

Outcome
This project demonstrates graduate-level understanding of cloud migration planning
and enterprise cloud adoption strategy, supporting roles in Cloud Engineering,
Cloud Analytics, and IT Infrastructure modernization.
